Computes the final temperatures of all regions of a piece of alloy if the piece of alloy's top-left and bottom-right corners are heated. The temperatures are computes recursively by breaking the matrix represenging the piece of metal into smaller and smaller chunks until each chunk is a 2x2 matrix itself, then each of its elements' temperatures are computes. This is achieved using the fork -join  model, and more specifically, java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction.
